#Bucket âœ“ | TechLadies Bootcamp Application

Hello! This is my web application for the TechLadies Bootcamp Application! 
The web app I designed, Bucket, is a Bucketlist or wish-list app whereby a user
can create articles for everything she wants to do, and others can comment on her
ideas and articles. Only the main user can create posts (I have yet to create a User model so
this only uses the basic HTTP authentication (sorry about that!) ) but posts and
comments are public. 

This is my first time designing a web app - I hope it's up to par for the programme! 
A big thank you to the TechLadies team for reviewing and considering my work :)

Best regards,
Chelsia
